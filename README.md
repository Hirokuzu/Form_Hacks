# Google Form Hacking

Playing around with Google Spreadsheets and Forms through own website.
First will be attempting to try the (Lehigh University Tutorial)[http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~spear/cse398/tutorials/googleformhacks.html].
Second will use the (Mozilla Developer Network tutorial)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms].
Third will use the Sneakysheep's (Google Forms Tool Version 2)[http://sneakysheep.com/google-docs-form-tool-version-2/].

## Other stuff

As well, this will be practice for using Git's features to better understand how things work.
Logging will be done in some way, but not yet determined. The Wiki seems good, but not sure how it ties in with the rest of Git's functionality. I would like some way to document any learning experience from this project.
