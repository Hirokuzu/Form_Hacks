* Finished basic form, using `fieldset` tags to differentiate between pages.
* Plan is to use JQuery to swap between `fieldset`s as if they were pages.

* Switch to PHP, add conditionals and validation for certain values, moving to
  different pages
* JQuery plan scrapped cause tutorials found [here](http://www.html-form-guide.com/php-form/php-form-validation-tutorial.html) and [here](http://www.html-form-guide.com/php-form/php-order-form.html) (same site, and [here](http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_sessions.asp) W3schools :O ). Will look for
  other similar things... maybe.
* Realize that more PHP needs to be learned by yours truly.
