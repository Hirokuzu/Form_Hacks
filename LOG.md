* Finished basic form, using `fieldset` tags to differentiate between pages.
* Plan is to use JQuery to swap between `fieldset`s as if they were pages.

### 2016-04-22 Evening

* Switch to PHP, add conditionals and validation for certain values, moving to
  different pages
* JQuery plan scrapped cause tutorials found
  [here](http://www.html-form-guide.com/php-form/php-form-validation-tutorial.html)
  and [here](http://www.html-form-guide.com/php-form/php-order-form.html)
  (same site), and [here](http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_sessions.asp)
  (W3schools :O). Will look for other similar things... maybe.
* Realize that more PHP needs to be learned by yours truly.
